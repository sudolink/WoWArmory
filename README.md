An attempt to emulate World of Warcraft's Armory functionality. Needs an API server that feeds it data from a mysql db (built for the vmangos emulation pack), the wowarmoryapiserver in my repos was made for this.

Basic functionality available right now. It probably breaks easily with unintended use at the moment.
